> I’m an Associate Professor in the Department of Engineering at Durham University. I started out in Mechanical Engineering, earning my BSc and MSc from Sharif University of Technology in Iran, then moved to EPFL in Switzerland for my PhD before moving to the UK and joing Durham. My research interest lies at the intersection of fluid dynamics, environmental science, and sustainable energy, with a strong focus on offshore wind. In my group, we use theory, simulations, and laboratory experiments to understand how wind turbines and wind farms interact with the atmosphere. Perhaps colleagues in the wind energy community know me best for developing analytical (engineering) wake models (such as the Gaussian/Bastankhah wake model) which are widely used in both academia and industry, and implemented in tools like FLORIS (NREL) and PyWake (DTU). My main passion in research is developing simple, easy-to-understand models by simplifying the complex mathematical equations that govern fluid motion; models that are rooted in fundamental physics yet practical enough to be used in the fast-paced world of industry. In recent years, my research interests have expanded to include the development of data-driven methods that integrate with and build upon physics-based modeling.

> **Short bio**:  
> I am a PhD student working on floating offshore wind at Durham University. I am interested in how wind flows interact with floating wind turbines, especially because these turbines can move in all six degrees of freedom. Before starting my PhD, I studied mechanical engineering and worked with numerical tools for analysing wind flow and performance. I enjoy building simple and practical models that help reduce uncertainty in wind energy applications.

> **Research project**:  
> My research focuses on understanding and modelling the two-way interaction between atmospheric wind flows and floating offshore wind turbines. Because floating turbines move (surge, sway, heave, roll, pitch and yaw), many common wind-energy tasks such as power performance testing, energy yield analysis, wake modelling, induction and blockage effects, and forecasting become more uncertain.  
>  
> In my project, I work on identifying, quantifying, and reducing these uncertainties. I study how turbine motion changes upstream, lateral and downstream flow behaviour in single turbines, pairs, rows, and large wind-farm clusters. The project involves reviewing existing modelling approaches, developing new or improved models, using numerical tools, and engaging with EDF experts and industry partners to ensure the methods are relevant and practical for real floating wind farms.
