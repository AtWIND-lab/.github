# 👥 AtWind Research Group Members

Welcome to **AtWind — the Atmospheric and Wind Research Group** at [Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk/).  
We conduct research on **wind energy, atmospheric flows, and environmental fluid mechanics**, combining theory, experiments, and numerical modeling to better understand complex flow phenomena.

> *I am a fluid dynamicist who is passionate about environmental science and sustainable energy, particularly offshore wind. I am currently an associate professor in the Department of Engineering at Durham University, UK. In our research, we employ theoretical, numerical, and experimental approaches to study the aerodynamics of wind turbines and wind farms. Our research aims to narrow the gap between theory and practice, contributing towards addressing important wind farm optimisation challenges that the wind energy industry currently faces. We pioneered the development of fast-running, physics-based mathematical models to optimise the efficiency of wind farms and their complex interaction with atmospheric turbulent flows. Our developed models are widely used in both research and industry and are parts of widely-used wind energy software packages such as FLORIS of NREL and PyWake of DTU. I serve as an Associate Editor for Wind Energy Science and am also a member of the Editorial Board of Wind Energy. Apart from conducting research, teaching is an integral part of my academic career, and I enjoy teaching thermo-fluid courses and designing new modules at both undergraduate and graduate levels. I am a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA) and also the recipient of the 2021 Teaching Prize awarded by the Department of Engineering at Durham University.*
