# 🌬️ Bastankhah Research Group

Welcome to the **Bastankhah Research Group** at [Shiraz University](https://www.shirazu.ac.ir/).  
We study **wind energy, fluid mechanics, and environmental flows**, combining theory, experiments, and computational modeling to better understand and optimize complex flow systems.

Our GitHub organization hosts open-source codes, datasets, and resources related to our research publications.
